- üëã Hi, Welcome to the MinePY Project GitHub !

Thanks for taking a bit of your time to read our Presentation !

- üëÄ What is the goal of our project ?

Our goal is to recreate the well-known Minecraft Game,
combining all of its best features accross all of its versions.
For a long time, people have been saying that Minecraft was coded with the a$$.

This is not completely wrong, that's why, our project is called MinePY,

Yes...

We're recreating Minecraft in Python !

- üå± Why use Python for a game ?

Python has been for a long time one of the best coding language, with a large choice of utilisations.
Going from Script to Website coding, Python is probably one of the most modular and poweful coding language nowadays.

Letting you make almost everything, with a big community base, as well as a big documentation and lots of tutorials.

It's also a very light weight language, making your code smaller makes your game/script/website run faster and smoother.

So it's everything we want for MinePY !

- üíûÔ∏è What are you using to create MinePY ?

Currently, the whole game has been developed on Ursina Engine, letting us create a variety of options and making the game
development slightly faster.

Of course, using engines, reduce a bit your possibilities, because you're limited by the engine capacities. But for now,
with the options and things we put in our game, Ursina does more than the job. And we will still be able to make several
updates to the game, before being really stuck by the engine.

- üéÑ Why do you want to recreate Minecraft ?

Even though Minecraft, is a really good game, it has some really annoying bugs and usage that makes the game experience less
enjoyable. Especially in older versions. For example, FPS drops, lag spikes, slow world generation, difficulty to produce
high render distances, and many more. 

The real point of recreating Minecraft, is that we will be able to make whatever we like or want. Today, the only way you can
really modify Minecraft, is by Mods, and mods aren't bad, but they're just an addon on an unofficial version of Minecraft.

And as you may have noticed it, you need pretty powerful computers to run a high modded minecraft.

That's where MinePY comes into place, MinePY is created by us, gamers, and long-time Minecraft players, so we know what players
want, as we are also players. MinePY isn't just a copy of Minecraft, it's a REMASTER, a complete makeover, with improved
performance and improved game experience.

And last but not least, many more features that are not on Minecraft, like custom Bosses, and many more that we don't want to spoil :)

- üì´ How to help us ?

MinePY is a community project, this is the main reason we have a github. This repo will help us share informations with you,
and also let YOU, share your ideas with our team and the community. We want MinePY to be able to satisfy every player.

And to achieve this goal, we need to have a way to discuss with the community.

Soon we will release a website (in Python lol) to let you guys informed about the game updates, as well as a forum, and the
launcher installer :) !

We will also release an appeal system for Python Developers or maybe some other jobs, so stay tuned.
