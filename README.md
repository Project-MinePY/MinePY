- 👋 Hi, Welcome to the MinePY Project GitHub !

Thanks for taking a bit of your time to read our Presentation !

- 👀 What is the goal of our project ?

Our goal is to re-create the well-known Minecraft Game,
combining all of its best features accross all of its versions.
For a long time, people have been saying that Minecraft was coded with the a$$.

This is not completely wrong, that's why, our project is called MinePY,

Yes...

We're re-creating Minecraft in Python !

- 🌱 Why use Python for a game ?

Python has been for a long time one of the best coding language, with a large choice of utilisations.
Going from Script to Website coding, Python is probably one of the most modular and poweful coding language nowadays.

Letting you make almost everything, with a big community base, as well as a big documentation and lots of tutorials.

It's also a very light weight language, making your code smaller makes your game/script/website run faster and smoother.

So it's everything we want for MinePY !

- 💞️ What are you using to create MinePY ?

Currently, the whole game has been developed on Ursina Engine, letting us create a variety of options and making the game
development slightly faster.

Of course, using engines, reduce a bit your possibilities, because you're limited by the engine capacities. But for now,
with the options and things we put in our game, Ursina does more than the job. And we will still be able to make several
updates to the game, before being really stuck by the engine.

- 📫 How to help us ?

MinePY is a community project, this is the main reason we have a github. This repo will help us share informations with you,
and also let YOU, share your ideas with our team and the community. We want MinePY to be able to satisfy every player.

And to achieve this goal, we need to have a way to discuss with the community.

Soon we will release a website (in Python lol) to let you guys informed about the game updates, as well as a forum, and the
launcher installer :) !
